Problem 1 - informal pseudocode

Given two numbers.

Add the two numbers together.
Return the result of the addition.

Problem 1 - Formal PseudoCode

START

GET first number
SET number1
GET second number
SET number2

SET result = READ number1 + READ number2

PRINT result

END

Problem 2

START

# Take an array of strings and return a string that is all those strings concatenated together.

SET arrayString
SET stringCount = value of the amount of strings in arrayString
SET concatString = ""
SET iterator = 0

WHILE iterator <= stringCount

    SET concatString = concatString + arrayString[iterator]
    SET iterator = iterator + 1

RETURN concatString

END

Problem 3

START

# Take an array of integers, returns a new array with every other element from the original array, starting with the first element

SET arrayInts
SET newArrayInts
SET arrayIntsSize = size of the array of Ints
SET iterator = 0

WHILE iterator <= arrayIntsSize
    IF iterator == 0
        SET newArrayInts = arrayInts[iterator]
    ELSE
        SET newArrayInts = newArrayInts + arrayInts[iterator + 2]
        SET iterator = iterator + 2

PRINT newArrayInts

END
