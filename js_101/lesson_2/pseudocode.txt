START

GET first number
SET number1
GET second number
SET number2

END

Problem 2

START

# Take an array of strings and return a string that is all those strings concatenated together.

SET arrayString
SET stringCount = value of the amount of strings in arrayString
SET concatString = ""
SET iterator = 0

WHILE iterator <= stringCount

    SET concatString = concatString + arrayString[iterator]
    SET iterator = iterator + 1

PRINT concatString
